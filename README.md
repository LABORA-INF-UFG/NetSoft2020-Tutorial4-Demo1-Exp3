In this demo, the elements of [Software Radio Systems LTE](https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE) compose of RAN and core of 4G. The main goal of this experiment is to demonstrate a connection between UE in hardware (conventional cell phone), RAN in hardware (SDR - Software-Defined Radio) and software, and EPC core implemented in software.

The minimum hardware requirement and software to run this experiment is shown in the figure below.
